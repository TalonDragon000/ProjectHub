=== BUGS ===

- profile view should track unique visitors, not page loads

- anon feedback and reviews should not be visible to non-owners

- profile update notification should be some "toast" within user's view instead of set at the top of the screen or at least moved next to the "save changes" button.

- feedback and reviews should have a sort filter 

- check on runtime error on profile page

### Profile Views Should Track Unique Users

**Issue:**
Profile view counts currently increment on every page load rather than tracking unique visitors. This inflates view statistics and doesn't provide accurate engagement metrics.

**Planned Fix (v0.1.3):**
- Create `profile_views` table similar to `demo_views` structure
- Add unique constraints on `(profile_id, viewer_profile_id)` and `(profile_id, viewer_session_id)`
- Implement `record_profile_view()` RPC function
- Update ProfilePage component to call tracking function on mount
- Add profile view analytics to creator dashboard

**Status:** Scheduled for v0.1.3
